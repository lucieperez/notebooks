### Story
Every evening at precisely six o’clock, the town of Harrowgate seemed to pause and listen.

First came the high silver chiming of the hilltop clocktower—twelve bright notes that danced across the rooftops like light on water. Then, almost a full breath later, the lower, older bells of St. Warden’s Church answered, their voices deep and worn, as if every toll carried the dust of centuries.

No one listened more closely than Elsie Merrin.

Elsie repaired clocks for a living. Her little shop, “Merrin Timepieces,” sat at the corner where Market Street curved toward the river, its front window crowded with clocks of every size. Some ticked with soft, polite sounds; others clunked and wheezed and rang with a stubborn will of their own.

Inside, the air smelled of oil, brass, and wood shavings. Elsie spent her days with a magnifying lens pressed to one eye, coaxing life back into stopped pocket-watches and heirloom wall clocks. To most of the town, she was simply the quiet woman with clever fingers. To the clocks and bells—if such things could have opinions—she was something like a doctor, and something like a friend.

On a Tuesday in late autumn, when mist blurred the cobbles and wrapped the town in a soft gray shawl, something unusual happened.

At five minutes to six, every clock in Elsie’s shop stopped.

The ticking vanished all at once, like a breath held by a hundred tiny lungs. The pendulums froze, the balance wheels stilled, the hands hung motionless—each of them pointing to some private, random moment that was not five to six. The silence that followed felt heavy enough to touch.

Elsie blinked, thinking first of a power cut, though many of the clocks were wound by hand. She checked the mainspring of the nearest one, then another, then three more, moving faster each time.

Nothing was broken.

She pressed her ear to a tall mahogany grandfather clock. Its heart should have been beating against her cheek, a steady tick-tock like a faint second pulse. Instead there was…something else. Not silence. A distant, trembling sound, like a bell heard underwater.

She straightened, her spine prickling.

From the hilltop clocktower came the first chime of six o’clock, clear and bright and alone.

It rang once. Twice. Three times.

The sound left a shiver in the glass panes of her windows, in the silver spoons in the kitchen drawer upstairs, even in her teeth. But that wasn’t the strange part.

The strange part was that St. Warden’s bells did not answer.

At the fourth chime from the hill, Elsie stepped outside. Market Street lay in a kind of listening hush. A dog raised its head and whined, unsure. A couple who had been arguing in front of the bakery stopped speaking mid-sentence, mouths still parted. Every head tilted the same way: toward the church.

Ten…eleven…twelve.

The final chime faded, leaving only the faint creak of a signboard on its rusty chain. Still the church bells said nothing.

Elsie knew, as surely as she knew the taste of her own name, that something was wrong with the bells.

The clocks in her shop remained frozen.

That night, she barely slept. She lay awake listening to the silence between the tiny clicks and groans of settling wood in the old house. It felt as if time itself were walking carefully around Harrowgate, not quite daring to put its full weight down.

By morning, the story had grown legs.

“They say the bell-rope snapped,” the baker told her, flour dusting his eyebrows. “Old as those ropes are, I’m surprised it hasn’t happened sooner.”

“They say it wasn’t the rope at all,” whispered Mrs. Corby at the greengrocer’s stall. “They say the bells refused to ring. The verger pulled and pulled and they just…wouldn’t sound.”

Elsie felt the stopped watches in her pocket—she carried three that morning, unable to leave the mystery behind. They lay there like cold stones.

St. Warden’s Church was older than the rest of the town, stones blackened from centuries of rain and smoke. The bell tower rose above the square, sturdy and familiar, its narrow windows like watchful eyes. Elsie climbed the worn spiral of stairs, her hand on the cool rail, her breath clouding in the chill.

She had no official business there. But Harrowgate was small, and she had fixed the clocktower on the hill when it began to lose six minutes every week; people were used to her moving in the company of gears and bells.

At the top of the tower, dust hung in the air like pale cobwebs. The bells loomed above, massive dark shapes suspended by ancient beams. Their bronze sides were streaked with verdigris, their mouths gaping silently over the town.

“Mind the step, Miss Merrin.” The verger’s voice made her jump. He stood in the shadowed doorway, cap in hand. His name was Thomas Wyle, a thin man with tired eyes.

“I heard they didn’t ring last night,” Elsie said. “I thought I might…look.”

Thomas hesitated, then nodded. “Look all you like. They look the same to me. But when I pull the rope—nothing. Not even a tremble. Like the sound has gone out of them.”

Elsie walked slowly beneath the nearest bell. The great clapper hung still as stone. She touched one cool metal rim with her fingertips and felt that same faint tremor she’d heard in her shop: not silence, but a hidden sound too faint to catch.

“May I?” she asked, reaching for the rope.

Thomas watched. “You can, but it won’t—”

Elsie pulled. The bell swung, heavy and obedient.

No sound came.

The emptiness of that mute swing, the motion with no voice, unnerved her more than if the bell had screamed.

She released the rope and let the bell settle. It rocked once, twice, a huge sleeping beast. Again she pressed her ear against the metal.

This time she heard more clearly. Under the hush of the tower, under the slow creak of wood, under her own breath, there was a high, thin note like a distant ringing—far away and getting farther.

The sound was leaving.

“Have they ever done this before?” she asked.

“Not in my lifetime,” Thomas said. “Nor my father’s. Bells ring, bells crack, bells fall, God forbid. But they don’t go quiet for no reason at all.”

Elsie thought of her stopped clocks. Of the matching silence that had fallen over them at the exact moment the bells refused to sing.

“I think,” she said slowly, “that your bells are losing their time.”

Thomas blinked. “Their time?”

“Clocks measure time,” Elsie said, half to him, half to herself. “But bells… Bells divide it. They mark the hours, declare them, give them weight. When the bells sound, an hour becomes real to everyone who hears it. Perhaps that does something to time itself.”

He stared at her in the dim light. “You think the bells…carry time?”

“Or they’re bound up with it somehow.” She patted the bell’s flank. The faint, faraway ringing thrummed against her palm. “And I think something is pulling that time away.”

For the next few days, the town stumbled along without the evening toll from St. Warden’s. The hilltop clocktower still chimed on schedule, clear and untroubled. But in the shop on Market Street, clocks kept stopping.

Never all at once again, but one by one, as if some long, invisible tide were slowly withdrawing from their brass shores.

Elsie experimented. She wound the clocks, reset them, moved them closer to the window, farther from it. She took a small travel alarm and carried it up to the clocktower, then to the church. It always ticked faithfully next to the hilltop clock. Next to the mute church bells, it stuttered, slowed, and fell still.

It was there, beneath the weight of the silent bells, that she finally confessed the wild thought that had been growing at the edge of her mind.

“Thomas,” she said, “have you ever heard of a bell that could ring without being struck?”

His mouth twisted wryly. “That would be a neat trick. Save my back on Sundays.”

“I mean one that rings at…different times than it should. Or from different places.”

He hesitated. “My grandmother told stories,” he said at last. “Said in the very oldest days there was a bell that called the town out of danger, even before danger had properly arrived. War, flood, plague—the bell rang before the riders came, before the river swelled, before the fevers. People said it was cursed. Or blessed. Or both. They made the bell quiet in the end. Took it down. Melted it, my gran said.”

“Did they?” Elsie murmured. “Or did they only think they did?”

The faint far-off ringing in the bells was louder now. Not louder in volume—that high ghost-sound still barely brushed the edge of hearing—but more insistent, like a word on the tip of the tongue.

Elsie began to suspect that Harrowgate’s time had never been entirely its own.

Maybe, she thought, an old bell with a mind of its own had once agreed to take on some of the burden of time for the town. To bear its hours, to soften its worst moments, to shout warnings ahead of disasters. Maybe it had been broken apart, melted down, reshaped—but metal remembers. Sound remembers. Time most of all remembers.

If that bell had been divided and remade, where would its pieces have gone?

Into other bells.

Into clocks.

Into anything that marked and measured the invisible river everyone floated on without ever seeing it.

That night, Elsie sat in the middle of her shop long after she should have gone to bed. She lit a second lamp, then a third, until the room shone bright as midday. All around her, clock faces glinted. Most were still frozen. A few twitched, as if trying to move, then gave up.

She took from her workbench a small handbell she’d bought years ago at a market stall. It had always appealed to her—a simple brass cup on a carved wooden handle. It rang in a clear, steady tone that made people straighten their backs without knowing why.

She struck it lightly.

The sound leaped through the shelves, waking echoes in the stopped clocks. For a heartbeat, hands shivered toward motion, balance wheels shuddered. Then everything fell quiet again.

Elsie struck it harder.

The note rang out, pure and bright—and did not fade.

It hung in the air, sustained beyond what such a bell should have been able to hold. It layered itself over the unseen tremor she’d heard in the church bells, and for the first time, the two sounds met.

She felt it then—not in her ears, but in the skin of her arms, the back of her neck, the bones of her chest. A tug, gentle but firm, pulling from very far away.

Not away, she realized. Aside.

Sideways, into some narrow place where bells might ring without end and time might twist on itself into loops and knots.

Her heart thudded. She set the handbell down carefully and whispered into the humming air, “If you can hear me…you don’t have to go.”

The humming rose. A few clocks jerked into motion. One of the oldest, a cracked carriage clock with a missing handle, ticked wildly for three seconds, then stopped at once, its single hand pointing straight up.

Midnight.

No. Not midnight. A middle point.

Halfway between then and now.

Elsie pushed through the fear fizzing in her veins like static and made a decision that felt as absurd as it did necessary.

If something was drawing Harrowgate’s time sideways, she would go after it.

She chose three instruments for the journey: the handbell, a sturdy pocket-watch with a glass face she had polished so often it was almost a mirror, and a small key made of mixed metals—brass, bronze, a line of silver in its teeth—that she had once found soldered deep in the innards of a clock with no keyhole.

She wound the pocket-watch until the spring was tight enough that it almost hummed. She took the handbell in her right hand and the strange key in her left. Then she did something she had never done before.

She rang the bell in a rhythm no clock had ever kept: not seconds, not minutes, but the odd counting-beat of her own heart.

With each strike, she twisted the key—first right, then left, as if unlocking something only half-remembered.

The air in the shop thickened. The bright lamplight bent at the edges, slanting toward the corner where the oldest clocks huddled.

Tick. Tick. Tickticktick—

The stopped hands on the walls and shelves spun backward all at once. Shadows unrolled along the floor, stretching and curling. The buzzing feeling inside her skull snapped sharp as a wire pulled too tight.

Elsie closed her eyes, kept ringing, kept turning the key, and stepped forward.

The floor did not meet her foot where she expected it.

Instead, she stepped onto something that was not quite air and not quite stone—a surface that held her weight but gave the sensation of infinite depth beneath, like walking on the skin of very calm water.

She opened her eyes.

The shop was gone. Or rather, it was there, but wrong: transparent and drained of color, like a faint painting on tinted glass. Beyond its ghost-walls lay streets she knew, also pale and distant. Yet over all of it, like a second city superimposed on the first, was a world of shining mechanisms and suspended bells.

Above her, enormous clock faces turned with no visible support, their numerals shifting and changing—Roman, Arabic, runes she did not recognize. Gears as tall as houses turned slowly in silence, their teeth meshing with nothing but empty air, yet still they moved. Chains of metallic links hung from nowhere to nowhere, and threaded along them were bells of every size and shape. They swayed though no wind blew, whispering faint high notes that made the hairs on her arms stand up.

Elsie realized she was standing in a narrow corridor of time.

Not time as a river, as she’d always heard it described, but time as a great clockwork—intricate, layered, full of passages and hidden chambers where lost seconds and mislaid days might end up if one was not careful.

And there, a little way ahead, was the sound she had been chasing.

A long, low tolling, stretched thin and aching. It came from a bell that was cracked through the middle, but still whole enough to ring. Around its rim she saw symbols she recognized from the oldest of her clocks, marks no modern maker used.

The bell—the oldest bell, she thought—was snagged on a jagged gear that did not belong where it was. The gear’s teeth bit into the bell’s lip, pulling it sideways, further and further from the place where Harrowgate’s hours should have run.

As the bell slid, it dragged a thin shining thread behind it. That thread led back, out of this tangled corridor, all the way to the faint image of St. Warden’s tower, where the real bells hung silent.

Elsie approached carefully. The nearer she drew, the more difficult it became to move. The air was syrup-thick here with overlapping moments. She saw, in the corner of her eye, flickers of the town’s days: a woman stooping to tie a child’s boot, a cart’s wheel hitting a stone, a man laughing, then coughing, then laughing again. All those fragments clung to the shining thread like burrs on cloth, being dragged out of their proper place.

She understood then: the old bell’s time-binding had come loose. Instead of holding Harrowgate’s hours steady, it was hauling them out of the world entirely.

“You’re not meant to be here,” she told the bell, absurd though it felt. “You’re meant to stand with the others. To ring when the world needs you. Not to leave us without any hours at all.”

The bell’s cracked side vibrated with a low, almost inaudible hum. She felt sorrow in it. Weariness. Bells were made to ring. To bear the weight of joy and terror, of weddings and funerals, of beginning and end. How many centuries had this one borne?

She touched the strange key to the gear that held the bell fast.

The gear jerked. Its teeth shuddered and then, like something caught doing wrong, began to grind backward.

Elsie took the handbell and rang it once, hard.

The note it gave rang both here and…elsewhere. She saw it shiver through the ghostly image of her shop, tremble through St. Warden’s tower, skip up to the hilltop clock. It wove itself into the thread of stolen hours, not to pull them further away, but to knit them back in.

“Come on,” she said through gritted teeth, turning the key against the resisting gear. “You’re not done.”

Slowly, the old bell slid free.

As it did, the shining thread slackened. Moments tumbled from it like beads from a broken string, rolling, bouncing, finding their way back to their rightful places. Someone elsewhere in town suddenly remembered the joke they had meant to tell yesterday. A child’s scraped knee that had stubbornly refused to heal began to close. The clocks in Elsie’s pale, unreal shop flickered with a hint of motion.

The old bell hung for a heartbeat between paths. It could complete its slide into whatever far corridor had been calling it, ringing forever in a place where no ears could hear. Or it could swing back toward the world it had watched over all this time.

Elsie lifted her handbell again, but this time she did not strike it.

Softly, steadily, she spoke instead.

“You’ve warned us,” she said. “You woke us to danger we didn’t see. You carried the weight when hours were too heavy for us. You were never cursed. And you were never just metal. Go back. Not because we command you, but because we remember you. Because we need you. Because the days are not finished yet.”

For a moment there was only the thick, pressed silence of time between ticks.

Then the great cracked bell swayed.

It swung away from the wrong path, toward the thread that led home. As it moved, it did not ring out. It inhaled. She had never before known a bell could take in breath, but that was how it felt: time itself gathered up in preparation.

The corridor of mechanisms shuddered. Gears realigned, chains unknotted. Bells overhead stilled, as if in respect, and then whispered, just once, a faint agreement.

Light—if that was what it was—rushed toward Elsie. It came from every direction, filled with the glint of seconds and the glow of lost afternoons. The pale image of Harrowgate brightened, deepened, solidified.

She closed her eyes.

The handbell slipped from her hand and struck the floor.

She heard its fall twice: once in the corridor of bells and clocks, and once in the very normal, very dusty, very real shop on Market Street.

When she opened her eyes, she was back. The lamplight was warm and steady. The room smelled of brass and oil and somewhat singed wick. Her heart raced, but the floor was reassuringly solid wood beneath her boots.

Around her, every clock in the shop was ticking.

Some fast, some slow, some embarrassingly out of sync—but ticking.

She laughed then, a short, astonished sound. It felt like a bubble rising up from very deep water.

Outside, the hilltop clocktower chimed the hour.

One. Two. Three.

Elsie checked the nearest clockface. Eight o’clock. She had been gone—if she had been gone—for two hours. Or no time at all. Or some other measure entirely.

Four. Five. Six.

And then, from St. Warden’s, came the answer.

The church bells rang out in glorious, overlapping peals. Not only twelve strokes for the hour, but a wild, uncounted chorus, as if they were making up for every silence they’d held. The sound rolled through Harrowgate, shook dust from rafters, rattled glasses on shelves, made every sleeping cat open one lazy eye and then close it again.

In her shop, the clocks did something they had never done before: for three, perhaps four seconds, every single one of them synchronized. Their hands pointed at the exact same mark. Their pendulums swung in a shared rhythm. The tick-tock, usually a chaotic forest of sound, became one deep, steady heartbeat.

Tick.

Tock.

Tick.

Tock.

It passed quickly. Clocks drifted a little ahead or behind, pendulums found their own particular swing. But Elsie had heard it. So, she suspected, had anyone whose window had been open in that moment.

The next day, Thomas Wyle came to her shop carrying a small bundle wrapped in cloth.

“They rang like mad yesterday,” he said without preamble. “Gave half the congregation a fright. But they’re…better. Lighter. Like their weight’s been shared out. I thought you should see this.”

He unwrapped the bundle. Inside lay a flake of metal, not much bigger than a thumbprint, bronze shot through with a line of some paler alloy. Cracked at one edge, smoothed at the other, it looked like a chip fallen long ago from a larger whole.

“Found it under the main bell,” he said softly. “I don’t know how long it’s been there. But I thought of you. And your clocks.”

Elsie took the fragment. It was cold at first touch, then warmed quickly in her palm.

If she listened closely, she fancied she could hear the faintest echo of a ring—softer than a sigh, older than the town.

“Thank you,” she said.

She melted the fragment and folded it into the pendulum of a new clock she was making—a plain wall clock, the sort you might hang in a kitchen and never think twice about. When it was done, she hung it above her workbench.

It was nothing special to look at. But it kept time with a steadiness that made the other clocks around it behave a little better, as if they, too, were soothed by some deep, patient rhythm.

In the years that followed, Harrowgate had its share of troubles and celebrations. There were floods and feasts, hard winters and long summers. People were born and people died. Bells rang for all of it.

Sometimes, late in the afternoon, just before the hour, Elsie would stand in her doorway and listen.

The hilltop clock would begin its measured chime.

One. Two. Three.

The church bells would lift their voices in response, rich and sure.

And, now and then—only now and then—there would be a third sound under the others: a note so quiet most ears would miss it, hovering between the ticks of the world.

A secret bell, still watching the town.

A clock’s soft, unseen heartbeat, steadying the hours for those who walked within them.

Elsie would touch the key that now hung on a chain around her neck and smile to herself, feeling the familiar, comforting weight of seconds falling into place.

The bells and the clocks had found their balance again.

Time went on.
