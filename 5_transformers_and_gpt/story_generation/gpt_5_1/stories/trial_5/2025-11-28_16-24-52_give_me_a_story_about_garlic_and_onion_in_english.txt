### Story
Garlic and Onion lived side by side in a small wooden crate in the back of a busy kitchen.

Every morning, the chef’s hands would reach in and take a little of both: a clove of garlic here, half an onion there. And every morning, Garlic and Onion would argue.

“You ruin everything,” Onion said. “The second you come in, that’s all anyone can taste.”

Garlic scoffed. “At least people remember me. They just cry when they see you.”

Onion bristled. “They cry because they’re moved by my depth and emotion.”

“They cry because their eyes burn,” Garlic replied.

Despite their bickering, they always ended up in the same pan, sizzling together in hot oil. The chef would toss them in at the beginning of almost every dish. As they cooked, the kitchen filled with a rich, familiar smell that made everyone passing by a little bit hungrier.

One evening, a fancy food critic came to the restaurant. The kitchen was buzzing. The chef decided to create something new: a special soup that would show the critic everything the restaurant could do.

He lifted Garlic out of the crate. “Tonight,” Garlic whispered to Onion, “I’ll finally get the spotlight I deserve.”

But then the chef picked up Onion too. “Of course,” Onion muttered, “he needs me.”

Garlic went into the pot first, crushed and sizzling in butter. The aroma was strong, warm, and inviting. The kitchen staff smiled.

“Smells amazing,” someone said.

Garlic smirked. “Hear that?”

Then Onion joined in, chopped and tossed into the pot. At first, its sharp scent pushed through the steam. But as the heat worked its magic, Onion softened, turning sweet and mellow. The kitchen filled with a deeper, rounder smell.

The chef added broth, herbs, and a few vegetables, but Garlic and Onion knew they were still the heart of the dish. They simmered together, their flavors weaving and blending until it was impossible to tell exactly where one ended and the other began.

In the dining room, the critic took a spoonful of the soup and paused. Then another spoonful. Then another.

“This,” the critic said quietly, “tastes like home. Simple ingredients, perfectly balanced.”

Back in the pot, Garlic was quiet.

“Well,” Onion said softly, “say it.”

“Say what?” murmured Garlic.

“That you needed me.”

Garlic hesitated. “Fine. Maybe… maybe you help people taste me better.”

Onion chuckled. “And you keep me from being too serious. We… complete the dish.”

They simmered in companionable silence for a while.

“Do you think,” Garlic said at last, “that’s why the chef always uses us together?”

Onion considered this. “He knows something we forget—that strength isn’t about which flavor is louder. It’s about how well we blend.”

From that day on, Garlic and Onion still argued from time to time, but never quite as sharply. Whenever they reached the pan and heard the first quiet sizzle, they remembered the bowl of soup that had impressed the critic and filled the room with warmth.

And in every stew, stir-fry, and sauce that followed, they worked together—sharp and sweet, strong and subtle—turning simple food into something that felt like comfort.

No one ever ordered “just garlic” or “only onion” at that restaurant. They simply asked for the dish.

But in every bite, Garlic and Onion were there, side by side, proud to have learned that some flavors are best when they share the spotlight.
