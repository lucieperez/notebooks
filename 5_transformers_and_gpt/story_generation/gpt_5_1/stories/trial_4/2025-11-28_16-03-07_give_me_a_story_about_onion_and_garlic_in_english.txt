### Story
Once upon a time in a small, sunlit kitchen, there lived an Onion and a Garlic clove side by side in a wooden bowl.

Every day, Onion boasted, “I am the star of every dish! People chop me first, and I make them cry. That’s power!”

Garlic laughed softly. “You make them cry because you’re too strong all at once. I may be small, but one little clove of me can make the whole kitchen smell wonderful.”

Onion puffed up his papery chest. “Smell? I bring depth and sweetness when I’m cooked. Stews, soups, curries—everyone needs me!”

Garlic replied, “Yes, they need you. But they love me. Listen to them: ‘Add a bit more garlic, please!’ they always say.”

The two argued like this for days, each certain that they were more important.

One evening, the Cook came into the kitchen, humming. “Tonight,” she said, “I’ll make something special.”

Her hand reached into the bowl and picked up Onion. “You first,” she said, peeling and slicing him. Onion felt proud, even as tears filled the Cook’s eyes.

Then she picked up Garlic, pressing each clove under the flat side of her knife. Smash, peel, chop—Garlic released his warm, rich scent into the air.

Onion whispered from the cutting board, “We’re both going in the pan?”

“Of course,” Garlic said. “You’ll see.”

The Cook heated some oil and dropped Onion in. Sizzle! Onion began to soften, turning golden, releasing a gentle sweetness. He felt himself growing more and more delicious.

Soon the Cook added Garlic. The pan filled with a deep, heavenly aroma as the two cooked together.

“Careful not to burn the garlic,” the Cook murmured to herself, stirring with love and attention. She added tomatoes, herbs, a bit of salt, and let everything simmer.

Onion listened to the bubbles. “Garlic,” he said quietly, “the Cook is treating you very carefully.”

Garlic answered, “She needs us both. You’re the body of the sauce. I am the spark. Together we become something better than either of us alone.”

When the sauce was finished, the family gathered at the table. They took their first bites and smiled.

“This is perfect,” said one.
“So rich and comforting,” said another.
“The flavor is amazing. Did you add garlic?” a child asked.
“There’s onion too,” the Cook replied. “They’re working together.”

In the pot, Onion and Garlic felt a warm happiness spread through them. Their argument suddenly seemed silly.

From that day on, whenever Onion felt like boasting, he remembered the sauce and said instead, “I give dishes their heart.”

And Garlic, who could still be a little proud, would add, “And I give them their soul.”

They never argued about who was more important again, because they knew the truth: in the best dishes, they were always together.

And in that small, sunlit kitchen, side by side in the wooden bowl, Onion and Garlic waited happily for their next adventure in a pan.
