### Story
Garlic and Onion were neighbors in a small wooden crate at the back of Mrs. Lina’s kitchen.

Every day, the two vegetables listened to the sounds of the house: the hiss of oil on the stove, the clatter of pans, and the laughter of people eating at the table.

Onion was proud.  
“I am the star of every dish,” Onion said. “Without me, the soup is boring, the stew is weak, and the cook is lost.”

Garlic laughed softly.  
“You are important,” Garlic agreed, “but so am I. A little bit of me can change everything.”

Onion rolled around in the crate.  
“You? You are so small! And you smell so strong that people complain about their breath afterward.”

Garlic smiled.  
“Maybe. But they still come back for another bite, don’t they?”

One day, Mrs. Lina opened the crate.

“Hmm,” she said. “Today I’ll make a special soup.”

Her hands reached in and picked up Onion.

“See?” Onion whispered proudly. “I told you. I’m first.”

Onion went to the cutting board. Chop, chop, chop. Onion tried to be brave, but as soon as the knife cut in, Onion began to cry—well, to make everyone else cry.

Mrs. Lina’s eyes watered.  
“Oh, Onion,” she said, wiping her tears. “You always make me cry, but I still love you.”

Onion felt proud again. Being necessary, even when it made people cry, felt like a strange kind of honor.

Then Mrs. Lina reached back into the crate and picked up Garlic.

Garlic was peeled and minced into tiny pieces.

“Careful,” Onion said, a little softer now. “That looks painful.”

Garlic only replied, “This is what I’m here for.”

Into the hot pot they went. Onion went first, sizzling in the oil, turning soft and golden, releasing a sweet and rich smell. The kitchen filled with warmth.

“Ah,” thought Onion. “Listen to that! Smell that! I am amazing.”

Then Garlic dropped in. The moment Garlic touched the hot oil, a new aroma burst into the air: warm, deep, and comforting.

“Hey…” Onion thought, surprised. “Now we smell… perfect.”

Mrs. Lina smiled as she stirred.  
“Onion for sweetness, garlic for soul,” she whispered to herself. “Together, you’re magic.”

Onion listened.

“Together,” Onion repeated quietly.

As the soup cooked, other ingredients joined in: carrots, tomatoes, a bit of meat, herbs, and salt. But it was the mix of Garlic and Onion that held everything together, like two old friends telling stories in the same pot.

That evening, the family sat at the table with bowls of steaming soup.

They took their first spoonful, and their faces lit up.

“This is delicious!” one said.  
“So warm and comforting,” said another.

No one spoke directly about Garlic and Onion. No one said, “It’s the garlic!” or “It’s the onion!” But in the quiet steam rising from the bowls, Garlic and Onion knew.

In the pot, they rested together, their flavors blended so completely that you could no longer tell where Onion ended and Garlic began.

“Maybe,” Onion whispered, “being the star is not the most important thing.”

“Maybe not,” Garlic answered. “Maybe the most important thing is how we taste together.”

From that day on, Onion no longer bragged, and Garlic no longer teased. Whenever Mrs. Lina reached into the crate, the two friends hoped they’d be chosen at the same time.

Because Garlic and Onion had learned something simple and true:

Alone, they were good.  
Together, they were unforgettable.
