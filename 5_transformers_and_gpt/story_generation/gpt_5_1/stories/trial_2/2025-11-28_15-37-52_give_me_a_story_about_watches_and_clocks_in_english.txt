### Story
On the edge of a small town stood a crooked brick shop with a faded wooden sign:  

**MERIDIEN & SON – HOROLOGISTS**  

The sign was old enough that the “& SON” had almost flaked away. Inside, the air smelled faintly of oil, brass, and dust, and time itself seemed to tick at a hundred different tempos at once.

Watches lay in velvet-lined drawers. Carriage clocks sat like small metal houses on the shelves. A great grandfather clock watched the room from the corner, its long pendulum moving with a slow, patient rhythm, as if it were breathing.

The shop belonged to Mr. Meridien, a thin, white-haired man who always wore three watches: one on his left wrist, one on his right, and one pinned to the inside of his vest. He claimed they each kept a different kind of time.

One rainy afternoon, a boy named Tom pushed open the door. A bell chimed, but the sound it made was not a simple ding—more like a small, bright chord, as if several tiny voices had sung the note together.

Tom wiped his wet shoes on the mat and looked around, wide-eyed.

“Good afternoon,” said Mr. Meridien. “Have you come to buy a watch, or have you lost one?”

“Neither,” Tom said. “My grandfather’s clock stopped. Nobody can fix it. Mum says I should buy a new one, but Grandpa says that clock has our family’s time in it. He’s… he’s in hospital now, and he wants it working again.”

Mr. Meridien’s expression softened.

“Ah,” he said. “Family time. Very delicate. Show me.”

Tom carefully lifted a heavy, cloth-wrapped bundle from his backpack and set it on the counter. Inside was a small, old mantel clock made of dark wood. Its glass face was cracked in the corner, and its hands were frozen at seven minutes past eleven.

The moment the clock touched the worn counter, the entire shop seemed to pause. The ticking of the other clocks dimmed, like the sound of a crowd suddenly holding its breath.

“Interesting,” murmured Mr. Meridien. He adjusted his round spectacles and leaned in. “Do you know when it stopped?”

“The night my grandfather fell,” Tom said. “He slipped down the stairs. That’s when the paramedics came. Eleven-oh-seven, Mum said. That’s what the wall clock in the kitchen read, too.”

“Your grandfather fell at eleven-oh-seven,” repeated Mr. Meridien. “And this one stopped at eleven-oh-seven. Consistency is rare among clocks. Most are jealous; they like to argue about the minute.”

Tom frowned. “Is that… a joke?”

“Only partly.” Mr. Meridien gently opened the clock’s back panel. Inside, gears stood like a crowded city of brass, tiny teeth locked together in silence. “Clocks argue with each other constantly, you know. Each one believes it knows the true time. That’s why they seldom agree. Your grandfather’s clock, however… this one is loyal.”

Tom wasn’t sure if the man was eccentric or just very poetic, but he said nothing. He watched the old horologist lift the clock with surprising tenderness.

“I will need to ask it a few questions,” said Mr. Meridien. “Would you like to listen?”

“To a clock?” Tom asked.

“Once you learn to listen,” said the old man, “everything speaks.”

He carried the clock to a high stool near his workbench and set it beneath a bright lamp. Around them, other timepieces ticked in overlapping patterns: fast clicking wristwatches, slow, weighty wall clocks, the deep, steady heartbeat of the grandfather clock in the corner.

Mr. Meridien took out a small brass key, oddly shaped, with a tiny glass gem at the center. It glimmered faintly, though the lamp above them did not change.

“What’s that for?” Tom asked.

“This?” The old man smiled. “This winds more than springs. It winds moments. Memories, too, sometimes. Every good clockmaker has one, though most pretend it’s only for show.”

He slipped the key into the back of the mantel clock. Instead of turning it, he held it still and closed his eyes.

The shop grew quieter. The ticking faded until Tom could hear only his own breathing. Then, slowly, faint sounds drifted around them—not from outside, but from inside the little wooden case.

He heard the buzz of a television. Laughter. A kettle whistling. Someone humming an old tune. Then a man’s voice, low and warm.

“Steady now, Tom. One step, then another. You’ll get it.”

“Grandpa?” Tom whispered.

Mr. Meridien opened his eyes and gently withdrew the key. The sounds faded like smoke.

“Clocks keep more than seconds,” he said softly. “This one has held your grandfather’s days for a very long time.”

Tom swallowed hard. “Can you fix it?”

“I can,” said Mr. Meridien. “But I must warn you: when a clock like this stops, it is not always because something is broken. Sometimes, it is because it refuses to go on.”

“Refuses?” Tom said. “Why would a clock do that?”

“Because the person it belongs to has come to a turning point,” replied the old man. “This clock knew your grandfather’s fall was… important. It paused there, as if marking a page.”

Tom’s hands curled on the counter. “He might not come home again. The doctors… they’re not sure. Mum cries when she thinks I’m not looking. If you fix the clock… does it mean he’ll get better?”

Mr. Meridien looked at him with kind, tired eyes.

“Clocks do not command lives,” he said. “They only measure them. But a broken clock can weigh on a house like a bad dream. It reminds everyone that something has gone wrong and not been put right.” He paused. “Sometimes, repairing the measure can help the heart remember how to move forward, even when it is afraid.”

Tom nodded slowly. “Then fix it, please.”

The horologist smiled and set to work.

He removed the clock’s hands first, laying them gently on a square of velvet. Then he lifted out the face, revealing deeper gears beneath, each one thinner and more delicate than the last. He used tweezers to pluck out a speck of dust, a bent tooth, a hairline crack.

“Every clock has a wound,” he murmured. “Some visible, some not.”

As he worked, the other clocks in the shop seemed to respond. The wall clocks softened their ticks, falling into a calmer rhythm. The wristwatches quieted down, like a restless class of children whose teacher had raised a hand.

“Why do you have so many?” Tom asked. “Don’t they drive you crazy, all ticking at once?”

“They are my choir,” said Mr. Meridien. “Each sings in its own voice. Some rush, some crawl, some nearly dance. Together, they remind me that time is not a single, straight line. It is a thousand paths, all leading forward at once.”

He examined the tiny escapement of Tom’s grandfather’s clock—a glittering, triangular piece that controlled the beat, like a heart valve setting the pulse.

“Ah,” he said softly. “Here it is.”

“What?”

“The fear,” answered the old man. “A hesitation lodged right in the escapement. Look.”

He handed Tom a magnifying lens. Through it, Tom saw the smallest fracture, almost invisible unless the light caught it just right. Around it were thin scratches, as if the little part had tried to move and then caught, over and over.

“How can metal have fear?” Tom asked.

“Why shouldn’t it?” replied Mr. Meridien. “It spends its life worrying about being too fast or too slow. And when something terrible happens nearby, it soaks up the moment, just as fabric holds scent.” He straightened. “But fear can be mended, just like brass.”

He replaced the cracked piece with a new one, carefully shaped and polished. Then he re-set the gears, balanced the pendulum within the case, and reattached the hands, but he left them at eleven-oh-seven.

“Aren’t you going to set it to the right time?” Tom asked.

The horologist shook his head. “Not yet. Some moments must be faced before they can be left behind.”

He wound the clock gently. The spring inside tightened with a soft, singing sound. Tom held his breath.

Tick.  

The sound was small, but clear.  

Tock.  

The second hand gave a tiny jump, then another. The clock began to beat, shyly at first, then with growing confidence.

As it did, the air around them thickened again, and a fresh wave of images shimmered at the corners of Tom’s vision—his grandfather in the garden, tying tomato plants; his hands guiding Tom’s small fingers over a chessboard; his voice reading stories late at night when Tom should have been asleep.

Then the memories changed. There was the sound of a muffled thump. A sharp breath. A frightened call for help. The angle of the hallway light on stairs. Eleven-oh-seven. The moment everything had stopped.

Tom’s chest tightened. The clock’s ticking grew louder, pressing against his ears.

“Breathe,” said Mr. Meridien quietly. “Moments do not vanish because we avoid them. They grow heavier. Let it pass through you.”

Tom shut his eyes and let the sounds unfold. The paramedics’ hurried steps. His mother’s voice, high and scared. The rush to the hospital. The long hours in the waiting room.

Tears slipped down his cheeks. He wiped them roughly away, angry at himself for crying in front of a stranger, but the old man said nothing. He simply rested one thin hand on the top of the working clock, steady as its beating heart.

Slowly, the pressure lightened. The sounds faded. The ticking softened again, settling into an even rhythm.

“There,” said Mr. Meridien. “Now it is truly fixed.”

He gently moved the clock’s hands forward, carefully, minute by minute, as if walking them over stepping stones. Eleven-oh-eight, eleven-oh-nine, eleven-ten… Each little movement felt like a breath let go.

When he reached the current time, he set the clock down. It ticked on, calm and steady.

“Take it home,” he said. “Put it where your grandfather can hear it when he returns, or… wherever it feels right. Let it remind you that that night was one moment, not every moment. Time did not end there.”

Tom sniffed and nodded, tracing the smooth edge of the wooden case.

“How much do I owe you?” he asked, reaching for his pocket.

Mr. Meridien held up a hand. “Bring me something instead.”

“Like what?”

“A story,” the horologist replied. “Come back in a few weeks and tell me how your grandfather is. That will be enough.”

Tom hesitated, then nodded. He wrapped the clock in the cloth again, but when he lifted it, it seemed lighter, as if a stone inside had been removed.

He was halfway to the door when he paused.

“Mr. Meridien?”

“Yes?”

“Why do you wear three watches?”

The old man raised his left wrist. “This one belongs to the town,” he said. “It tells me when shops open, when trains leave, when letters are late. The ordinary time everyone shares.”

He raised his right. “This one belongs to me. It is always five minutes slow, because my thoughts tend to wander behind the world.”

He tapped the watch pinned inside his vest. “And this one doesn’t keep numbers at all. It keeps… elsewhere.”

“Elsewhere?” Tom echoed.

“Moments that happen sideways,” said the horologist. “A child’s first step. A last goodbye. A decision that changes everything, though no one sees it at the time. If I need to remember that time is not only what the clock on the wall says, I listen to this one.”

“I don’t hear anything,” Tom admitted.

“Come back when you’re older,” Mr. Meridien said. “You might.”

Tom pushed open the door. The bell above it sang its many-voiced note again. Outside, the rain had stopped, and the puddles on the street reflected the gray sky like shallow, shattered mirrors.

He walked quickly toward the hospital, the steady heartbeat of the clock in his backpack keeping pace with his own.

—

Weeks later, Mr. Meridien was adjusting the weights on the grandfather clock when the doorbell chimed. Tom stepped in, carrying the same clock, though this time he held it openly, not wrapped in cloth.

“How is he?” asked the horologist at once.

Tom’s face broke into a smile. “He’s home. He has to use a cane now, and he moves slower, but he’s… he’s still Grandpa.”

“And the clock?” Mr. Meridien asked.

Tom set it on the counter. It was ticking strongly.

“He listens to it at night,” Tom said. “He says it sounds different now. He says… it sounds like it forgave itself.”

“A wise clock,” said the old man.

“I brought you a story,” Tom said. “Is that enough to pay you?”

“More than enough.”

So Tom told him: about the first night Grandpa slept at home, murmuring along with the ticking; about the way his mother stopped flinching every time the clock chimed; about how, when the hour struck seven, Grandpa would say, “Still here,” and smile.

When he finished, Mr. Meridien nodded, satisfied.

“Good,” he said. “You see? Clocks cannot change what has happened. But now, every time it ticks, it says: ‘This, too, is time. This, too, is life.’”

Tom looked around at the crowded shelves.

“Do you fix everyone’s time like that?” he asked. “All these watches and clocks?”

The old man chuckled softly. “Only when they ask nicely,” he said. “Some only want their batteries changed.”

Outside, the church bell in the square began to ring the hour. Inside the shop, dozens of watches and clocks joined in, each in its own way—some early, some late, some perfectly on cue. It should have sounded chaotic, but somehow it didn’t. It sounded like layers of days, all singing at once.

Tom stood there, listening, until the chimes faded. Then he picked up his grandfather’s clock again.

“May I come back sometimes?” he asked.

“To visit, or to listen?” Mr. Meridien replied.

“Both.”

“Then I will be here,” said the horologist. “As long as time allows.”

Tom stepped back out into the afternoon, feeling, for the first time in a long while, that the future was not an empty, frightening space—but a path measured in small, steady ticks, each one carrying him forward.

Behind him, in the crooked brick shop, the clocks and watches kept on talking to each other, arguing and agreeing and overlapping, weaving their many different beats into one endless conversation called time.
