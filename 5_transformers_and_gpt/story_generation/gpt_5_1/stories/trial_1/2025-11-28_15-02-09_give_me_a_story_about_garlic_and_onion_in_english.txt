### Story
Garlic and Onion were neighbors in a small vegetable garden behind an old stone house.

Garlic was bold and confident. He wore a white coat of many cloves and carried a strong smell that announced his presence before he even spoke.

Onion was quieter. He wore thin, papery skin in shades of gold and purple, and he always worried that people would cry when they met him.

One morning, the Cook came into the garden with a basket.

“I need something special for tonight’s soup,” she said. “Something that will warm the heart.”

Garlic puffed out his chest. “She’ll pick me,” he whispered. “Everyone knows I make food exciting.”

Onion lowered his head. “She’ll avoid me,” he sighed. “No one likes tears.”

The Cook walked along the rows, humming softly. She stopped first by the carrots, then by the celery. Finally, she stood before Garlic and Onion.

“Hmm,” she said. “I think I need… both of you.”

“Both?” Onion asked, surprised.

“Of course,” said the Cook. “Garlic brings fire and courage. Onion brings depth and comfort. Together, you make something unforgettable.”

Garlic winked at Onion. “Looks like we’re a team.”

As they were carried to the kitchen, Onion trembled. “What if I make her cry?” he whispered.

“You probably will,” said Garlic honestly, “but only for a moment. After that, she’ll taste how wonderful you are.”

In the warm kitchen, the Cook peeled Onion’s papery layers. As she sliced, her eyes filled with tears.

“I’m sorry,” Onion murmured.

But the Cook only smiled through the water in her eyes. “It’s all right,” she said. “Some good things begin with a few tears.”

Then she chopped Garlic, releasing a sharp, rich aroma into the air.

The two friends met again in a pot of sizzling oil. Garlic sizzled first, turning golden and fragrant. Onion followed, softening and turning sweet.

“Smell that,” the Cook said, breathing in deeply. “This is the beginning of something wonderful.”

As they cooked together, Garlic’s sharpness softened, and Onion’s sadness melted into sweetness. Their flavors mingled and grew, richer and richer, until the whole house was filled with a comforting scent.

That evening, the family gathered around the table. They tasted the soup and smiled.

“It’s perfect,” someone said. “Warm and bright, strong and gentle at the same time.”

In the pot, Garlic whispered to Onion, “See? They needed both of us.”

Onion glowed quietly. “Maybe it’s all right to cause a few tears, if it leads to something warm and good.”

From that day on, whenever the Cook wanted to make something special, she always called for both Garlic and Onion.

And in the little garden behind the old stone house, two friends stood side by side, knowing that alone they were interesting—but together, they were unforgettable.
