### Story
In the center of the city stood a narrow shop squeezed between a bakery and a pharmacy. Its sign was small, made of brass, and read:

**“Verity Timepieces – Repairs & Restorations”**

Inside, hundreds of watches and clocks covered the walls. Cuckoo clocks perched high near the ceiling, their doors shut tight like closed beaks. Grandfather clocks stood against the back wall like tall, patient guardians. Glass cases near the front displayed wristwatches of every kind: thin and gold, thick and steel, with leather bands worn soft from years of use.

The owner was an old man named Mr. Verity. His white hair was always a little wild, and his round glasses slid down his nose when he worked. He rarely looked at the large digital clock on the wall, which beeped every hour. Instead, he trusted the quiet heartbeat of the mechanical watches ticking all around him.

One rainy afternoon, a boy named Leo pushed open the door. A bell chimed overhead—a clear, gentle note that seemed too beautiful to come from such a small bell.

Leo was eleven years old and always late: late for school, late for dinner, late for everything. Not because he didn’t care, but because time felt slippery to him, like water running through his fingers. He had come to the shop with something wrapped carefully in a handkerchief.

“Excuse me,” Leo said, stepping inside. All around him, the soft ticking filled the air like invisible rain. He stopped, surprised. The sound felt alive.

Mr. Verity looked up from his workbench. “Good afternoon,” he said. “What brings you here?”

“I… I have a watch,” Leo said, walking to the counter. He placed the wrapped bundle in front of the old man and slowly unfolded the cloth. Inside lay a small pocket watch with a cracked glass face and tarnished silver case.

“It was my grandfather’s,” Leo explained. “It doesn’t work anymore. My mom says it’s broken for good, but… I thought maybe you could fix it.”

Mr. Verity picked up the pocket watch as if it were something rare and fragile. He turned it over in his hands, pressed the crown, held it to his ear.

“No ticking,” he murmured. “But not dead. Just silent.”

“Can you fix it?” Leo asked.

The old man smiled slightly. “Timepieces don’t like to be thrown away. They like to remember. Let’s see what it remembers.”

He took out a small key, thin as a needle, and opened the back of the watch. Inside, a maze of tiny gears waited, frozen mid-motion.

Leo watched, fascinated. “How do you know what to do?”

“Every watch and clock has its own language,” Mr. Verity said. “Some are loud and impatient.” He gestured toward a red alarm clock on the shelf that ticked too fast, almost angrily. “Some are slow and thoughtful.” He pointed to an old wooden wall clock with a deep, lazy tick. “This one”—he lifted Leo’s watch—“was careful. Precise. Someone who valued it set it often.”

“That was my grandpa,” Leo said quietly. “He never went anywhere without it.”

“Then we must be respectful,” Mr. Verity replied.

He put on a pair of magnifying lenses that flipped down over his glasses and began to work. His tools were as small as insect legs. He cleaned the gears, adjusted the springs, and added the tiniest breath of oil. Leo watched each movement, feeling like he was watching someone gently wake a sleeping animal.

While he worked, the shop around them whispered with ticking and chiming. A tall grandfather clock in the corner struck three o’clock with three deep, ringing notes. On the half-hour, a small cuckoo clock let out a single, shy cuckoo, as if it were checking to see if anyone was listening.

“Why do you have so many clocks?” Leo asked.

“To keep company,” Mr. Verity said. “Most people think clocks measure time. But they do something more important: they keep us aware of it. They remind us that moments are passing, and that each one can be used or wasted.”

Leo looked down, embarrassed. “I waste a lot,” he said. “I’m always late.”

Mr. Verity tightened one last screw with a careful twist. “Are you late,” he asked gently, “or are you simply unaware?”

Leo frowned. “What’s the difference?”

The old man smiled. “Being late is a result. Being unaware is a habit. Habits can be changed.”

Before Leo could answer, a soft, clear sound slipped into the space between them: a tiny, regular tick tick tick.

The pocket watch had begun to move.

Leo’s eyes widened. “It’s working!”

“For now,” Mr. Verity said. “But it has a request.”

“A watch can’t—”

“In this shop,” the old man interrupted, “timepieces speak. Not with words, of course, but with rhythm.”

He held the watch close to Leo’s ear. “Listen.”

Leo listened. The ticking was steady, calm, like a quiet heartbeat.

“It doesn’t sound like anything,” Leo said.

“Close your eyes,” Mr. Verity suggested. “Imagine that each tick is a little message.”

Leo closed his eyes. Tick, tick, tick.

“What does it say?” the old man asked.

Leo waited, listening longer. At first it was only sound, but slowly his mind began to shape it. The ticks seemed to group themselves into pairs, then threes, as if they were steps. Tick-tick. Tick-tick. Tick. Tick-tick.

He frowned. “It’s like… footsteps. Like walking. Not running.”

“Good,” said Mr. Verity. “Your grandfather walked steadily through his days, I imagine. Not rushing, not drifting.”

Leo thought of his grandfather’s careful handwriting, his slow but certain way of speaking. “Yeah,” Leo said softly. “He always knew exactly when to leave the house to be on time. He used to tap his watch and say, ‘Time isn’t a race. It’s a path.’”

Mr. Verity nodded. “Then your watch remembers him well.”

He closed the back of the watch with a quiet click and polished the glass face with a soft cloth until it shone.

“Take it,” he said, offering the watch to Leo. “Wear it. But don’t just use it to see what time it is.”

“What else is it for?” Leo asked, taking the cool, silver watch in his hand.

“To decide what to do with your moments,” Mr. Verity said. “Look at it before you choose to wait, or to rush, or to ignore the passing of time.”

Leo slipped the watch into his pocket. It felt heavier than he expected, but not in a bad way. More like a promise than a weight.

“How much do I owe you?” he asked.

“For the repair?” Mr. Verity tilted his head, eyes twinkling. “You’ll pay me by listening.”

“Listening?”

“To time,” the old man said. “Come back in a week and tell me what you’ve heard.”

---

Over the next days, Leo tried to do exactly that.

On Monday morning, he woke up to his alarm as usual, but this time, he reached for the pocket watch on his bedside table. The tick tick tick met him like a small, steady voice. He watched the minute hand move forward, one tiny step at a time.

He decided to get out of bed right then instead of waiting for “just five more minutes.” Those five minutes had always turned into twenty. That day, he arrived at school five minutes early for the first time in his life.

On Wednesday, he sat with his homework open but felt tempted to check his phone. He pulled out the pocket watch instead. Tick tick tick. He thought of his grandfather’s words: Time isn’t a race. It’s a path.

“If I walk on the path now,” he told himself, “I’ll be free later.” He set a goal: he would work until the minute hand moved ten tiny steps. When it did, he gave himself a short break, then walked the path again.

On Friday, his friend Milo invited him to play a game online that would probably last half the night. Usually, Leo would say yes without thinking. This time, his fingers brushed the watch in his pocket. He thought about Saturday morning—soccer practice, his mom’s tired face when he overslept, the way everything always became a rush.

“Half an hour,” Leo told Milo. “Then I have to sleep.”

Milo grumbled but agreed. For once, Leo didn’t fall asleep on the bus the next day.

Each time Leo listened, the steady ticking began to feel less like a sound and more like a friendly nudge. It wasn’t telling him to hurry. It wasn’t telling him to stop. It was just reminding him that each moment was a choice.

---

A week later, Leo returned to the shop. When he opened the door, the same gentle bell rang, and the same chorus of clocks greeted him.

“You came,” Mr. Verity said, looking up from a tower of old wristwatches he was sorting.

“You said I had to pay you,” Leo replied. “With listening.”

“And?” The old man folded his hands. “What did you hear?”

Leo thought for a moment. “I heard… that time isn’t loud on its own. I make it loud when I ignore it, and it surprises me. If I pay attention, it’s quieter. Kinder.”

Mr. Verity smiled. “An excellent translation.”

Leo moved closer to the wall of clocks. “Do they… talk differently?” he asked, pointing at the different timepieces.

“Of course,” said Mr. Verity. He walked toward a large grandfather clock with a dark wooden case. Its pendulum swung slowly, each movement smooth and solemn.

“This one,” he said, “belongs to a family that has had it for four generations. It reminds them that their days are part of a much longer story.”

The clock ticked in a deep, comforting rhythm, like a slow drum.

He led Leo to a tiny travel alarm clock with scratches on its metal case. “This one has crossed continents. Its ticking is quicker, excited. It says, ‘Don’t oversleep; you might miss something wonderful.’”

Near the counter sat a dusty clock radio that had lost its sound, its red numbers blinking 12:00 again and again.

“And this one?” Leo asked.

“This one is confused,” Mr. Verity said. “It’s always waiting for someone to set it right. Some people live that way too—always waiting for someone else to wake them, to tell them what to do with their day.”

Leo shivered a little. He thought of all the times he had blamed buses, homework, or other people for his lateness, when really he had just been drifting.

“What about my watch?” he asked finally.

Mr. Verity looked at the pocket watch peeking from Leo’s pocket. “Your watch says, ‘Take care.’ Not just of time, but of yourself, of others, of the moments between things.”

“Moments between things?” Leo repeated.

“The waiting in line,” Mr. Verity said. “The walk between your home and school. The few minutes before dinner. Many people treat those as empty spaces, as if they don’t count. But clocks count them. Watches count them. Life happens there too.”

Leo thought of how he now used those little moments—to review a vocabulary word while walking, to help his mother set the table instead of scrolling his phone, to take three deep breaths before soccer practice instead of complaining about it.

He realized he felt less rushed, even though the days were the same length as before.

“Can I ask you something?” Leo said.

“Of course,” replied the old man.

“Why do you repair old watches and clocks? People have phones now. Digital stuff. It’s easier.”

Mr. Verity walked to the digital clock on the wall. It showed the time in bright red numbers: 4:15 PM.

“This clock tells you what time it is,” he said. “It’s accurate, but empty. It doesn’t care how you feel. It doesn’t remember anyone. When it breaks, most people throw it away and buy another.”

He turned and placed his hand gently on a small, worn wristwatch with a scratched leather band.

“This watch,” he continued, “was worn by a woman every day for forty years. She checked it before her first job interview, before catching the train to visit her sick mother, before walking down the aisle at her wedding. When her grandson brought it to me, he said it ‘smelled like her perfume.’”

He looked back at Leo. “Mechanical watches and clocks aren’t just tools. They are witnesses. They carry stories inside them. When I repair them, I am not restoring just timekeeping—I am restoring memory.”

Leo looked down at his grandfather’s pocket watch and ran his thumb over the edge of the case. He understood.

“So you’re like a… time librarian,” he said.

Mr. Verity laughed. “I suppose you could say that.”

Leo stood quietly for a moment, listening to the blended ticking in the shop. It no longer sounded like random noise. It sounded like many different lives, quietly overlapping.

“Will I always be late sometimes?” Leo asked suddenly.

“Yes,” said Mr. Verity without hesitation. “Everyone is late sometimes. Clocks can guide you, but they cannot live for you. The point is not to become perfect with time. The point is to become honest with it.”

“Honest how?” Leo asked.

“Honest enough to say, ‘I chose this,’ instead of, ‘Time ran away from me.’”

Leo nodded slowly. “I think… I want to choose more carefully.”

“Then keep listening,” the old man said, returning to his workbench. “Your watch will keep speaking. And if it ever falls silent again, bring it back. We’ll wake it up together.”

As Leo turned to leave, one of the cuckoo clocks burst open above his head. A tiny wooden bird popped out and sang, “Cuckoo! Cuckoo!” six times in a bright, cheerful voice.

Leo laughed. “What does that one say?”

“That one?” Mr. Verity said, looking up with a smile. “It says, ‘Don’t forget to enjoy it.’ Time, I mean. All this ticking and measuring is useless if you never stop to be glad you’re here at all.”

Leo stepped back out into the city street, the sound of the clocks fading behind him. The sky was turning golden with late afternoon light, and somewhere in the distance, a church bell rang the hour.

He slipped his hand into his pocket and felt the steady heartbeat of the watch against his palm.

Tick, tick, tick.

He didn’t hurry, and he didn’t drift. He simply walked, each step in time with the quiet, faithful ticking—aware, at last, that time wasn’t chasing him or leaving him behind.

It was walking beside him, and he had finally decided to listen.
